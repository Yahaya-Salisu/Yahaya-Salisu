I specialize in Solidity and EVM-based smart contract security. My work spans across DeFi protocols, including DEXs, lending, staking, RWA, NFT marketplaces, and reward systems. I'm comfortable with unfamiliar protocols, analyzing complex vault logic, modular architectures, and custom tokenomics.


### Tools & Techniques
1. **Slither** for static analysis  
2. **Manual code review** (my strongest skill)
3. **Remix**:
4. **Foundry**: for Fuzz testing, Unit testing, Mainnet forking, Interactive PoCs


### Track Record:
1. I found Contract Hijack vulnerability in lending protocol
2. I found Access control vulnerability in lending protocol
3. I found false deposit and over-redemption bug in staking systems.
4. I found over borrowing & over-repay in lending protocol.
5. I found unauthorized fee deduction in Dex 


### Availability
I'm currently **open to**
-  Full-time roles (Remote or Hybrid)
-  Part-time positions
-  Freelance / Bug Bounty-based work

You can hire me to audit your smart contract at **affordable rates**.  
I offer *per-contract*, *per-hour* and *per-week* pricing based on your scope and budget.

Let's discuss your project! I'm always open to building secure DeFi together.
